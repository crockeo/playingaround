#playingaround

##Description

It's just a simple text-adventure engine written in Haskell. I'unno if it's proper Haskell (since I've only really read over LYAHFGG only once, and I'm mostly a beginner to Haskell) so you may not want to go around using this as a learning resource for how to program in Haskell.
