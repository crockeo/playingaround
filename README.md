#playingaround

##Description

As per the title, this project was (and still is) me messing around with some
C-code as to further familiarize myself with C beyon what CS50x has taught me.

It's a simple text-based RPG game, where you can create very basic level
constructs without any coding, after the engine has been completed, of course.
